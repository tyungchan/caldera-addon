  description: Adversaries may create or take over botnets - networks of compromised
    systems - to perform coordinated tasks like large-scale phishing or Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They can build botnets by compromising third-party
    systems or redirect existing botnets to adversary-controlled servers, enabling
    widespread and scalable malicious activities.
