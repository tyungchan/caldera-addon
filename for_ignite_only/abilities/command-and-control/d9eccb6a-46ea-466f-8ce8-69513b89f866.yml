    SID 1:26025 to evade detection and blend malicious communication with legitimate
    web traffic. This activity aligns with T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol:
    Web Protocols), as attackers can use web protocols like HTTP/S for command and
    control or data exfiltration while bypassing monitoring systems.'
