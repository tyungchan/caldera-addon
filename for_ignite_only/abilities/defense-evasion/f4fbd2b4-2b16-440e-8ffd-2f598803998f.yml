  name: 'File: CSA - Compressed ZIP file'
  description: Adversaries often deliver malicious ZIP archives to compress and disguise
    payloads, bypassing email filters or antivirus scanning. These ZIP files may contain
    scripts, executables, or document-based exploits that activate upon extraction
    or user interaction. This method enables efficient delivery of malware while evading
    basic security controls.
