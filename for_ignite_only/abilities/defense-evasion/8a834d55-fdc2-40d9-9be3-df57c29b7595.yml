  description: Adversaries may use malicious PowerPoint files to deliver malware through
    embedded macros or exploits. These files often rely on user interaction, such
    as enabling content or clicking objects, to trigger the execution of payloads.
    Once activated, the embedded code may download additional malware or execute commands,
    serving as an initial access vector or payload delivery method.
