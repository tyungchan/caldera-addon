  description: Adversaries may exploit Valid Accounts to log into remote machines
    via Secure Shell (SSH), enabling them to perform actions as the logged-on user.
    SSH, a protocol for remote shell access, is commonly installed on Linux and macOS
    systems but often disabled by default. Adversaries can leverage standard password
    authentication or public-private key-pairs, placing the user's public key in the
    server's authorized keys file to gain access without raising suspicion.
