  description: Adversaries may abuse Valid Accounts to remotely control machines using
    Virtual Network Computing (VNC), a platform-independent system that allows screen,
    mouse, and keyboard control over the network. Unlike Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
    VNC focuses on screen sharing rather than resource sharing. VNC typically uses
    system authentication but can be configured to use its own credentials. Adversaries
    can use VNC for malicious activities such as opening files, downloading data,
    and executing commands, while also leveraging it for monitoring systems and gathering
    information for lateral movement within a network. Some VNC implementations are
    also vulnerable to brute force and memory exploitation attacks.
