  description: Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website
    over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser
    is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised
    websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token.
