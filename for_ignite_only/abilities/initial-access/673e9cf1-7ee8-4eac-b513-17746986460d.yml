  name: 'SnortML: Machine Learning-Based SQL Injection Detection'
  description: The adversary attempts to exploit a web application by injecting SQL-based
    payloads into HTTP request parameters. Traditional intrusion prevention rules
    rely on fixed patterns, making them ineffective against novel SQL injection variants.
    By leveraging SnortML, which utilizes machine learning models trained to detect
    SQL injection attempts, this attack can be identified and blocked in real-time,
    even if the specific payload has never been seen before.
