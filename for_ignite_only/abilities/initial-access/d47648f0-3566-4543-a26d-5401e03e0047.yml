  description: Adversaries may use spearphishing emails containing malicious links
    to gain access to victim systems. This variant of spearphishing avoids detection
    by delivering malware via a link instead of an attachment. These emails often
    employ social engineering, posing as a trusted source, to trick victims into clicking
    the link and downloading the malicious payload.
