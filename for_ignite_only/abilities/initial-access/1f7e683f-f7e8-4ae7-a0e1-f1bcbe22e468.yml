  name: 'Intrusion: HiMan exploit kit outbound POST connection'
  description: "Adversaries exploit the HiMan exploit kit by luring victims to malicious\
    \ or compromised websites, often through malvertising or phishing. Once visited,\
    \ the site silently fingerprints the user\u2019s system and delivers tailored\
    \ exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities in browsers or plugins like Java or Flash.\
    \ If successful, the exploit executes a payload\u2014such as a remote access trojan\
    \ or infostealer\u2014without user interaction. The infected host then sends a\
    \ distinct HTTP POST request back to the attacker\u2019s server, signaling a successful\
    \ compromise. This outbound traffic, detected by Snort rule SID 1:28966, marks\
    \ the final stage of a classic drive-by compromise attack."
