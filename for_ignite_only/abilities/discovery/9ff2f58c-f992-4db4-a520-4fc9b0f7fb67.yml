  description: Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather valuable
    system, configuration, and software information. The Registry holds crucial details
    about the operating system, software, and security settings, which can be queried
    using tools like Reg. This information helps adversaries with automated discovery
    and shapes their subsequent actions, such as deciding whether to fully infect
    a system or perform specific malicious tasks.
