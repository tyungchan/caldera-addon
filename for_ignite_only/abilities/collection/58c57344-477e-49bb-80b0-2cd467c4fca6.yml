  description: Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace
    to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials
    and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within
    a network. Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office
    365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools
    such as MailSniper can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.
