  name: 'Malware: Download Macro OLE exploit file'
  description: Adversaries may manipulate document templates, such as those in Office
    Open XML (OOXML) files or RTF files, to conceal malicious code or trigger authentication
    attempts. By modifying template properties or control words, they can reference
    external URLs to download and execute payloads when the document is opened. These
    attacks can evade detection since no traditional indicators like macros or scripts
    are present until the payload is fetched. This technique also enables forced authentication
    by injecting malicious URLs that prompt users for credentials. Such tactics are
    commonly used in phishing and data exfiltration attacks.
