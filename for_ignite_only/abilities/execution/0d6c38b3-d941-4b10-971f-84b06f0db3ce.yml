  name: 'Malware: CSA - Flash Vulnerabilities'
  description: Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in client applications, often due
    to insecure coding, to execute arbitrary code and gain remote access to systems.
    These vulnerabilities are valuable targets for exploitation, as they allow attackers
    to compromise systems by leveraging commonly used files that users expect to encounter.
