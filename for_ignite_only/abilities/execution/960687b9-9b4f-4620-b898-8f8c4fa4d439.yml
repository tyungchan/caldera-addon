  name: 'Malware: Download phishing attachment'
  description: Adversaries may use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
    to gain access to victim systems. These attachments, such as Office documents,
    executables, PDFs, or archived files, exploit vulnerabilities or execute malware
    when opened. The email typically uses social engineering, posing as a trusted
    source, and may include instructions to bypass security measures or decrypt the
    attachment. Adversaries often manipulate file extensions and icons to disguise
    malicious executables as legitimate documents to evade detection.
