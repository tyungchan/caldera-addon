  name: 'Malware: CSA - Potentially Unwanted File'
  description: Adversaries often rely on users opening malicious files to gain code
    execution, typically through social engineering techniques. These files, which
    can include .doc, .pdf, .xls, .exe, and others, may be disguised with familiar
    names or password protection to trick users into executing them. This behavior
    is commonly seen after initial access or internal spearphishing, where the malicious
    file is placed in accessible locations like shared directories or desktops. The
    goal is to manipulate users into executing the file, allowing the adversary to
    execute their payload.
