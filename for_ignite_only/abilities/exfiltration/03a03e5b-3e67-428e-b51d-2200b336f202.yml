  technique_name: 'Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites'
  technique_id: T1567.003
  name: 'Application: Pastebin (text storage site)'
  description: Adversaries often use public text storage services like Pastebin.com
    to host or share malicious content, such as command-and-control (C2) instructions,
    stolen data, or encoded payloads. These services are appealing because they allow
    anonymous posting, are widely accessible, and often evade security detection due
    to their legitimate use by developers and researchers. Attackers may program malware
    to fetch instructions or updates from these paste sites, making it harder to trace
    and block communications.
