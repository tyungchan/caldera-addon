  description: DLP (Data Loss Prevention) is essential for defending against adversaries
    because it helps detect, monitor, and block unauthorized access or transmission
    of sensitive data. Whether facing external attackers or insider threats, DLP acts
    as a safeguard by enforcing data handling policies, preventing data exfiltration,
    and minimizing the impact of compromised accounts. It ensures that critical information
    like personal data, financial records, or intellectual property doesn't leave
    the organization unintentionally or maliciously, making it a key layer in any
    modern cybersecurity defense strategy.
