  name: 'Cisco: Data Exfiltration to Pastebin'
  description: Data exfiltration simulations expose potential vulnerabilities in an
    organization's security posture. One common attack scenario involves leveraging
    public platforms like Pastebin for exfiltrating sensitive information. In this
    simulation, attackers mimic real-world tactics by transferring confidential data
    to Pastebin, exploiting its anonymous and widely accessible nature to evade detection.
