  description: The simulation of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) activities is not
    just a technical exercise; it's a crucial defense strategy against one of the
    most insidious forms of cyber threats. DGA represents a sophisticated technique
    employed by adversaries to automatically generate large number of domain names.
    These domains serve as ever-shifting rendezvous points with command-and-control
    (C2) servers, making the detection and blocking efforts of security systems a
    formidable challenge.
