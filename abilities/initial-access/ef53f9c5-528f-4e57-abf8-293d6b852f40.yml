  description: Exploit kits are pre-packaged sets of code and malware geared toward
    finding and taking advantage of common browser vulnerabilities. They are JavaScript
    code that provides an entry point to a system to initiate the next state. Snort's
    rules look for known exploit kit nomenclature, information sent back exposing
    sensitive infrastructure, attempts to reach a certain file, etc. Rules try to
    identify the exact kit being used based on actor-group patterns, such as favored
    target website, malware types, and code similarities.
