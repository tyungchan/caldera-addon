  name: 'Cisco: Spear Phishing Email Attachment'
  description: This test case simulation is crucial for validating the detection and
    response capabilities of Cisco XDR against suspicious email activities that could
    be used as an initial access vector by adversaries. It helps ensure that the system
    can effectively identify and flag potential threats, providing a robust defense
    against common attack techniques such as spear phishing and exploitation of vulnerabilities
    in public-facing systems.
